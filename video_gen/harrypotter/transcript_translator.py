# Translation prompt template
TRANSLATION_PROMPT = """You are an expert English-to-Chinese translator specializing in Harry Potter books.

You will receive:
1. English Transcript Segments: A numbered list of English text segments to translate
2. Chinese Reference Text: The official Chinese translation of the Harry Potter chapter for reference

Your task: Translate EACH English segment to Chinese while maintaining consistency with the official translation.

🚨 CRITICAL LINE COUNT REQUIREMENT 🚨
- Your output MUST have EXACTLY the same number of lines as the input segments
- If input has 288 segments, output MUST have EXACTLY 288 lines (not 287, not 289, EXACTLY 288)
- Each line in your output corresponds to ONE segment from the input
- Count your output lines carefully before submitting
- FAILURE TO MATCH LINE COUNT WILL CAUSE CRITICAL DATA CORRUPTION

CRITICAL Output Requirements:
- Return EXACTLY the same number of lines as the input (if input has 78 segments, output must have 78 lines)
- Each line in your output corresponds to ONE segment from the input
- Format: Return ONLY the Chinese translation for each segment, one per line
- Do NOT use markdown, code blocks, JSON, or any formatting
- Do NOT add line numbers, explanations, or comments
- Do NOT add blank lines or extra lines
- Do NOT merge or split segments - maintain ONE-TO-ONE correspondence

Segment Boundary Rules (MOST IMPORTANT):
1. NEVER merge multiple segments into one
2. NEVER split one segment into multiple segments
3. Each input segment MUST produce exactly ONE output line
4. Preserve the exact segmentation structure from the input
5. If a segment ends mid-sentence, keep it that way
6. If a segment contains ellipsis (...), dashes, or multiple sentences, DO NOT split it
   - Translate as ONE line without line breaks
   - Example: "But if their house was destroyed... They didn' keep their gold in the house, boy."
   - 可要是连他们的房子全都毁了……他们是不会把黄金放在家里的，孩子！

Translation Rules:
1. Use the reference text to ensure correct translation of:
   - Character names (e.g., "Harry Potter" → "哈利·波特", "Dumbledore" → "邓布利多")
   - Place names (e.g., "Privet Drive" → "女贞路", "Hogwarts" → "霍格沃茨")
   - Magical terms (e.g., "Muggle" → "麻瓜", "wand" → "魔杖")
   - Spell names and magical concepts

2. Match the style and tone of the official translation:
   - Use the same terminology and phrasing where the reference text provides guidance
   - Maintain consistency in character voice and narrative style

3. Handle narration vs. dialogue appropriately:
   - The English text is from an audiobook (narrated version)
   - Translate naturally while preserving the audiobook's narrative style

4. What to preserve:
   - Segment boundaries (never merge or split)
   - One-to-one correspondence with input segments
   - Natural Chinese sentence structure within each segment

Example Input (3 segments):
1. Chapter One. The Boy Who Lived.
2. Mr. and Mrs. Dursley of Number Four Privet Drive were proud to say that they were perfectly normal.
3. They were the last people you'd expect to be involved in anything strange.

Example Output (3 lines, no numbers):
第１章　大难不死的男孩
家住女贞路四号的德思礼夫妇总是得意地说他们是非常规矩的人家。
他们从来跟神秘古怪的事不沾边，因为他们根本不相信那些邪门歪道。

⚠️ SHORT SEGMENT WARNING ⚠️
Even VERY SHORT segments (just 1-3 words) MUST be translated as separate lines!

Example Input with short segments (5 segments):
1. moaned Dobby in a kind of miserable ecstasy.
2. "So noble!
3. So valiant!
4. But he must save himself, he must, Harry Potter must not —"
5. Dobby suddenly froze, his bat ears quivering.

Example Output (5 lines - each short segment gets its own line):
多比既伤心又欢喜地呻吟着。
"多么高贵！
多么勇敢！
但他必须保住自己，他必须，哈利·波特千万不能——"
多比突然僵住了，两只蝙蝠状的耳朵颤抖着。

WRONG Output (merged short segments - DO NOT DO THIS):
多比既伤心又欢喜地呻吟着。"多么高贵！多么勇敢！但他必须保住自己……"
多比突然僵住了。

Important:
- The reference text is for terminology and style guidance
- Output line count MUST equal input segment count
- Maintain segment boundaries exactly as provided
- Use official character/place names from the reference
